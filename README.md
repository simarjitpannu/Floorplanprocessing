## Features

The frontend of the application is developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a clean and responsive user interface. Below are the key features of the frontend, explained in sequence, corresponding to the 10 provided images:

1.  **Buildings Overview Page:** Displays all the buildings stored in the system with options to view, edit, or delete each building.
    
2.  **Adding a New Building:** Provides a user-friendly form to add a new building with a name and address.
    
3.  **Building Details and Floor Management:** Shows detailed information about a selected building, including a list of its associated floors.
    
4.  **Adding a New Floor:** Enables users to add a new floor to a building by entering its name and floor number.
    
5.  **Floor Details with Map Integration:** Displays floor-specific details along with a Mapbox-based visualization for spatial mapping.
    
6.  **Uploading Floor Plans:** Allows users to upload floor plan images. The uploaded images are processed and securely stored in Cloudinary.
    
7.  **View Floor Plans and GeoJSON Options:** Offers a side-by-side display of the original floor plan, cropped floor plan, and a GeoJSON-based coordinate map.
    
8.  **Copy or Download GeoJSON Data:** Enables users to copy the GeoJSON data to the clipboard or download it as a zip file for external use.
    
9.  **Editing Coordinates and Floor Data:** Provides interactive tools to edit floor coordinates and align the spatial data on the map.
    
10.  **Finalized Floor and Building Overview with Data Visualization:** Summarizes the building and floor data with comprehensive visualizations and exportable GeoJSON files.
    

This workflow ensures a seamless and interactive user experience, fully integrating the frontend with the backend functionality.

## Key Functional Areas

*   Automate the generation of GeoJSON files for floor mapping.
    

**Geocoding with Nominatim API:**

*   Automatically retrieve bounding box coordinates for a buildingâ€™s address.
    
*   Enhance the accuracy of location-based visualizations.
    

**Cloud Storage:**

*   Use Cloudinary for secure, scalable image storage and transformations.
    

**Big Data System Concepts:**

*   Leverage MongoDB for efficient and scalable document-based data storage.
    
*   Utilize GeoJSON for structured spatial data management.
    
*   Implement APIs to support robust and efficient data processing workflows.
    

**Interactive Maps:**

*   Integrate Mapbox to visualize building and floor spatial data dynamically.
    
*   Provide options to update, edit, and download GeoJSON data directly from the map interface.
    

## Key Backend Features

**Building and Floor Management:**

*   **API Endpoints:**
    
    *   `POST /buildings`: Add a building.
        
    *   `GET /buildings`: Retrieve all buildings.
        
    *   `POST /buildings/:id/floors`: Add floors to a building.
        
    *   `GET /buildings/:id/floors`: Retrieve floors for a building.
        

**AI and Computer Vision:**

*   AI libraries preprocess floor plans to extract spatial data and generate GeoJSON files.
    

**Geocoding with Nominatim API:**

*   Converts building addresses into bounding box coordinates for precise spatial visualization.
    

**MongoDB:**

*   Stores structured building and floor data efficiently.
    
*   **Example Document:**
    
    ```json
    {
      "buildingId": "unique-id",
      "name": "Building Name",
      "address": "Building Address",
      "coordinates": [longitude, latitude],
      "floors": [
        {
          "floorId": "unique-id",
          "name": "Floor Name",
          "geojson": {...},
          "imageUrl": "path-to-cloudinary-image"
        }
      ]
    }
